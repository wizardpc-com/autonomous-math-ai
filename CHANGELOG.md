# Changelog

All notable changes to Autonomous Math AI are documented in this file. The
format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository-local Codex discovery entry for the bundled `math-research`
  policy pack.
- `amr detect-tools --project-root` for writing a tool inventory into the
  selected research project rather than the harness checkout.
- Conjecture-neutral catalog, evidence, lifecycle, policy, and mechanical
  worker regression suites migrated from the former monorepo integration.

### Changed

- The harness now lives in its own source checkout and research repositories
  integrate exclusively through the installed `amr` CLI and project manifest.

### Planned

- Broader backend adapters and additional deterministic verifier integrations.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- Conjecture-neutral `amr` command-line interface and installable
  `autonomous_math_research` namespace.
- Declarative project manifests and a neutral starter template.
- Monotone campaign, epoch, and job lifecycle with crash recovery.
- Output Protocol v2 and a shared Structured Outputs preflight boundary.
- Immutable candidate bundles, audit leases, representation contracts, and a
  fail-closed canonical gate.
- Append-only steering, external asset ingest, route ledger, research map, and
  core capsule support.
- Controller-brokered, one-shot mechanical workers with bounded fallback.
- Windows and Ubuntu zero-model CI.

### Changed

- Public distribution renamed to `autonomous-math-ai`; the Python namespace
  and `amr` CLI remain stable.
